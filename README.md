Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
===========

This repository has been created to implement the course project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data at Coursera.

The contents of the repository are:

1. run_analysis.R - the main R script that reads data, performs cleaning, merging data sets as required and produces a tidy data set. This script generates a file TidyData.txt. The archive with data files for this project was downloaded from the following location: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Codebook.md - a document that describes the particular features in the tidy data set. The description of the original data set was retrieved from this URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

3. READMY.md - this introductory document.
