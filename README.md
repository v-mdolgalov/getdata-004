Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
===========

This repository has been created to implement the course project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data at Coursera.

The contents of the repository are:

1. run_analysis.R - the main R script that reads input data, performs cleaning, merging data sets as required and produces a tidy data set in the file TidyData.txt. The details of the script's logic are described in the Codebook.md document (see below). The archive with data files for this project was downloaded from the following location: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

2. Codebook.md - a document that describes the particular features in the tidy data set. The description of the original data set was retrieved from this URL: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

3. README.md - this overview document.

4. TidyData.txt - the resulting data set after execution run_analysis.R script.
